# orm-ecommerce

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to complete the back-end for an e-commerce site using existing starter code. The application uses Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

Clone the repository or download it as a zip file. Upon downloading, run `npm install` to install all dependencies. You will have to create your own `.env` file with your MySQL credentials.

within the mySQL shell, run `source db/schema.sql` to create the database.

`npm run seed` will seed the database with data.

`npm start` will start the server. You can then use Insomnia Core to test the routes.
